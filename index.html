			 <p>Trying out Bluesky again since it’s been more than a year when I first tried it (but didn’t like it) and I’m curious who’s on there now. So far I am enjoying the photography, gaming and game dev feed as its folks actually posting photos or taking about their projects which is so great.</p>

			 <p>The other day I realized how much I miss using my hands and creating anything, such as drawing or writing in a journal. I charged up my old iPad, bought a little stand for it on Amazon, and let my Apple Pencil glide. I usually prefer the texture of heavy gsm paper and markers, but I&rsquo;d love to practice using my iPad, and get good enough to stop the shaky hand thing that you get when your muscles aren&rsquo;t used to drawing. I had bought <a href="https://keshart.in/drawing-camp/">Kesh&rsquo;s drawing camp</a> because of an awesome deal over two years ago but never really started it! Let&rsquo;s see if I can put in 20 minutes a day to do it :D</p>

			 <p>The goal I&rsquo;ve had for 20 years is complete! It&rsquo;s taken everything through every job I&rsquo;ve had, part time, full time, during unemployment months, using savings, when I lived overseas in the UK, when I lived on my own, when I lived with my parents, when I lived with roommates. Every month for 20 years I paid a student loan payment - even when if it was a small amount.</p>
<p>That burden is now GONE! Yesterday I made my final payment and today it cleared! 🥳😭</p>
<p><img src="payment-cleared.png" alt="Payment Cleared" title="Paid in full!"></p>
<p>I have a sense of peace that I can&rsquo;t really describe. True freedom and happiness is being debt free (at least until if I start a home mortage or car loan again! 🤣). I need to enjoy this for as long as possible. It&rsquo;s given me hope to be more financially prepared for the future and I finally feel put together. I guess it&rsquo;s never too late achieve a goal huh?</p>
<p>I celebrated yesterday with a fun DJ stream too! I was very grateful for anyone who tuned in to hang out and vibe with me!</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s 2024! These past couple of months have been good so far. My mindset has changed since I feel better in terms of health and knowing where I stand with things to take care of. I feel like I&rsquo;m in control of my mind, body, and goals.</p>
<p><img src="BeatsBasementEp0-SS.jpg" alt="BinaryDigit on Twitch" title="B having a blast on stream!"></p>
<h2 id="twitch">Twitch</h2>
<p>For Twitch, I set up the downstairs space as a &ldquo;tiny studio&rdquo; for my DJ mix streams. I&rsquo;ve already gone live twice and have had a blast! I look forward to just walking downstairs, booting up, and easily starting a stream. It makes a huge difference when you a) aren&rsquo;t fatigued like before b) you have settings you don&rsquo;t need to change. The problem I had with doing two different styles of streams in my office were the constant changing of settings and programs. So that&rsquo;s resolved! I also got some awesome lights for the background. I&rsquo;ll update more things I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking medication to handle my pre-diabetes, and have lost 5 pounds since November. It&rsquo;s very slow, and with the holidays I got a bit derailed, but I didn&rsquo;t gain anything back at least. Time to start back up. I might create a subdomain/micro blog to keep track of how I&rsquo;m feeling that&rsquo;s not a standard part of this cafe. It&rsquo;s important for me to keep track of things since I just get back into bad habits way too easily. I don&rsquo;t have a choice any longer!</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to do here, but I know I need to start thinking about another job or way to make the same amount of money I&rsquo;m currently making. I still enjoy some parts of tech, but really don&rsquo;t like the way many things are going, and don&rsquo;t want to do what I&rsquo;ve done before (mainly in the support space). I&rsquo;m going to focus on fun projects and pay attention to social media like Mastodon, discord, and the better parts of &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; social media. It would be cool to work in the indie web space, or finally get a creative job. &hellip;somehow :)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m so happy to get Chevereto installed on a <a href="https://binarydigit.photos/?list=images&amp;sort=date_asc&amp;page=1">new domain</a>! They had a great sale on their one time purchase software, so I grabbed a copy. I wanted some more bells and whistles than their free version.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use this to upload galleries for travel (to share with friends) or blog posts. I still need to upload more to photos Glass, but those photos are edited and curated.</p>
<p>To this gallery I&rsquo;ve uploaded some photos from TwitchCon that just passed. Next up is most likely photos when visiting NY around Christmas. And most likely a dog photo album 🥰</p>

			 <p>I just learned that Neocities has a CLI and you can push a static site generator to it! This makes a hobby site way more easy. I&rsquo;d love to create a new retro theme based on Hugo then make that site dedicated to retro tech or retro web stuff. Time to get creative.</p>

			 <p>I finally got an awesome Hugo template up and running for my <a href="https://binarydigit.cafe">homepage</a> and learned <em>a lot</em> in the process. It&rsquo;s been rough but I&rsquo;m glad I stuck it out since now everything rebuilds easily and quickly!  I&rsquo;m hosting it on Netlify for free and will think of it as a &ldquo;digital garden&rdquo; - a place to keep thoughts, notes, projects, and anything I want to craft. It&rsquo;s also been nice to keep everything under one domain and use subdomains to help organize projects. In 2024 I&rsquo;d like to eliminate about 6-8 domains that I&rsquo;ve had over the years. I should be down to 3&hellip;not a bad pruning.  (Until I&rsquo;m tempted to buy again). 😄</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;ve had a lovely weekend so far. I didn&rsquo;t do much yesterday for my day off work, and today after taking care of some errands we went to the local retro video game store and found a second guitar for Guitar Hero (for PS2)!  I remember buying Rock Band for PS3, and I loved the drum set. That might be on my list to re-buy now many years later for the nostalgia!</p>
<p>I also saw DJ Hero at the store, but it was missing a few pieces. I want to keep an eye out for a complete set with the game, for either PS2 or PS3, now that we have both consoles at home. I never had it and now am curious how it is since I&rsquo;ve learned how to DJ earlier this year. 🙌🏽</p>

I&rsquo;ve been reading opinions and I think people don&rsquo;t move over because they feel &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; on what they know. I&rsquo;m glad I found this early on in my hobby and I&rsquo;ll stick with it. If I ever do a gig professionally where I need to rent gear, I&rsquo;ll worry about using something else if needed.

			 <p>I was able to fork a copy of Carbon, a really nice site where you can create and share pretty images of code. It&rsquo;s a great open source project that I was able to deploy with Netlify easily!</p>
<p>In case you also decide to fork and deploy your own version, I had to utilize <a href="https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon/issues/1438">this fix</a>. Once complete it ran perfectly.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday my partner and I met up with our D&amp;D crew. It was awesome since 1) we hadn&rsquo;t met up in a few months due to scheduling challenges and 2) we had two more friends join our campaign! It was a great time since they were also experienced, so we felt even more comfortable with them there. I still need more practice to get comfortable with improve, but that will come with time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today we slept in then went to a local retro video game store that we&rsquo;ve wanted to check out for a while. We were pleasantly surprised at how much they had in store! He grabbed some great Playstation 1 games and I was happy to find that they sold lots of D&amp;D merch! I bought my first pair of dice and they are beautiful 😍</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also grabbed this adorable Animal Crossing bell plushie - how could anyone resist the cuteness?

<p>We plan to visit our local more and more now that we&rsquo;ve discovered it!</p>

			 <p>I have a couple of cameras that I&rsquo;ve collected over the years from days where I dream of doing photography full time. I debate on selling them, but at this point I might keep them around because I still hang onto them hoping to shoot again as a hobby. Here&rsquo;s my list!</p>
<p>I have a Canon 5D Mark III. It was my dream camera for the longest time, ever since I wanted to learn how to shoot editorial, portrait and e-sports photography. As a full frame DSLR, it&rsquo;s a classic and a hefty tool, which I might regret getting rid of so I&rsquo;ll hang on for a bit longer 😂 I pair it with a Canon EF 35mm f/2 as my only lens (so far). I bought it used from B&amp;H and haven&rsquo;t had any problems with it, so no regrets.</p>
<p>I also have a Fujifilm X-T20, which I love because it&rsquo;s lighter, mirrorless, has 4K video, and I&rsquo;m able to use it for streaming with an Elgato capture card. So not only is it not collecting dust while I don&rsquo;t go out for photos, at least I can use it for Twitch and recording video with my PC 😄</p>
<p>My Fuji love began with my X-T10, which I would love to sell since it&rsquo;s a bit redundant since I upgraded to the T-20. Along with both cameras I have a ridiculous amount of lenses that I&rsquo;ve purchased and gotten as gifts throughout the years. I definitely need to sell them eventually, but they are gorgeous bits of glass. I even had a Fujifilm X-T2 at one point, but loved the smaller body of the XT series and I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t utilize the pro features of the XT2 at the time.</p>
<p>I used to love Adobe Lightroom back when you could purchase a single license and use it for a while. When they went to CC subscriptions, I did a couple of years of the Photoshop/Lightroom bundle, but after a while couldn&rsquo;t justify the fact that I didn&rsquo;t need huge catalogs and editing for a family portrait shoot now and again.</p>
<p>This year I discovered that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Capture One has an Express version <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for Fuji and Sony cameras. Sweet! I claimed my license for the Fujifilm version and can&rsquo;t wait to learn it. I can pair it with my Affinity Photo software for the few times I edit photos.</p>
<p>I also bought Flickr Pro this Black Friday since it was a great deal and I want to rebuild my portfolio. I had the unfortunate mistake of enabling the auto-uploadr on my phone app, then disabling it since I didn&rsquo;t want to use it, and Flickr removed all of my public photos in my gallery. Doesn&rsquo;t seem right, but also I didn&rsquo;t reach out to support since I only had about 10 photos posted. Still frustrating and a warning for those who might do the same thing!  Lessons learned</p>

			 <p>A new beginning in many ways - In terms of travel I moved from New York City to Detroit! (I&rsquo;ll do more posts on that later.) On the digital side of life I&rsquo;m slowly moving away from Instagram and now Twitter. It&rsquo;s now a hot mess that I really want to avoid using for personal connection. I&rsquo;ll still use those sites occasionally, but not nearly as often I used to.</p>
<p>Recently  I returned backto the #fediverse on #Mastodon – but had to migrate from my original instance at mastodon.technology where I was for a year or so. I settled upon Fosstodon, which has been my happy place for the last few days. I’m bringing it back to my roots of the early 2000s, where blogging was a thing, and social media wasn’t even around. Later social media was a nice feature to keep in touch with friends, but now it’s become both cesspool of business focused marketing an empty shell of no personalities (which I was a part of 😅). It’s tough to find actual good conversations now.</p>
<p>When Twitter and Tumblr first started, I loved them! You could spit out fun memes or random thoughts and it wasn’t a big deal. You could comment back and forth, and even put friends on a blogroll – remember those? or webrings? They were awesome to find new people to follow. Oh and let’s not forget RSS – the best protocol ever! I ready a great toot from someone describing the falling of RSS that I forgot to bookmark – basically RSS never displayed ads, and social media wants you to look at ads. ALL DAY LONG. So Google and other companies started to stop promoting RSS so that you could visit the social media sites to make money off of your eyeballs and data. It hit me like a ton of bricks!</p>
<p>I’ve “left” Facebook (I only have it open for my work account), pretty much have left Instagram, and will slowly leave Twitter. I hope that the people who I do enjoy to read about move over to Mastodon, but no worries if they don’t. I’ll need to curate my Twitter feed a bit more to focus on content that I like. I mainly use it to promote my Twitch livestream hobby and connect with other techs and gamers.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m very excited to come back to a simpler web and leave other popular social media slowly. If you like this blog, please follow me or this blog on the fediverse! You can also follow me on my website/Tumblr where I collect my thoughts, import tweets, toots, and still post some other fun things. If you want to get in touch with me, find me on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fosstodon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (less and less) or leave a comment.</p>
