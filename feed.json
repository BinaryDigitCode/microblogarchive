I'm in Michigan with my amazing boyfriend, his two awesome pups, in a house with my own game room/office, a big yard, a safe space. My parents are healthy, my brother is doing well, and I'm feeling decently. I know not many people get to make it to their 40s, but here I am feeling younger than ever to be honest. It's weird to express happiness and not make it sound like gloating, but friends have made sure to tell me that it's important to celebrate it as well. So thank you for anyone that reads this, and for everyone I've met in my community, for everyone who's back home in NY that I hope to see soon, and to my amazing boyfriend Keith who makes my world go round and my heart feel safe. I hope I get to spend the rest of my life with you, Pixel and Luna.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hope everyone kicks ass today! üíñü•∞</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:74%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/DorxfW5xBGSG8bVxRa\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/pokemon-inlove-sinnoh-piplup-DorxfW5xBGSG8bVxRa\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.binarydigit.cafe/uploads/2023/6397398c57.jpg\" /> \n",
